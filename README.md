## üåê overview

FinGraph is a production ready python project that models the network of companies, sectors, and supply chains as a graph. by representing entities as nodes and relationships as edges, FinGraph allows users to analyze systemic risk, sector contagion, and hidden dependencies in financial ecosystems

this project bridges finance, data science, and network analysis, giving you insights that go far beyond traditional spreadsheets and dashboards

## üï∏Ô∏è features

- graph construction: build a graph of companies and their supply-chain relationships

- centrality metrics: identify systemically important companies using PageRank, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality
 
- community detection: detect clusters of companies using the Louvain algorithm

- contagion simulation: simulate financial shocks through the network to see ripple effects

- interactive visualization: explore the network with PyVis interactive graphs

## ‚öôÔ∏è how does it work?
FinGraph models the financial ecosystem as a **graph of companies and supply-chain relationships**. here's the high-level workflow:

1. **data loading (ETL):**  
   - company metadata (`ticker`, `name`, `sector`, `country`, `market_cap`) is loaded  
   - supply-chain relationships (`supplier ‚Üí customer`) are read as edges

2. **graph construction:**   
   - entities become **nodes** and relationships become **edges** in a NetworkX graph  
   - additional metrics (centrality, community membership) are attached to nodes

3. **Network Analysis:**  
   - **centrality metrics** (pagerank, betweenness, eigenvector) identify systemically important companies  
   - **community detection** (louvain algorithm) finds clusters of interconnected firms

4. **Contagion Simulation:**  
   - financial shocks are simulated starting from chosen seed nodes
   - risk spreads along edges with a decay factor, producing a **risk score** for each company  

5. **Visualization:**  
   - nodes are colored based on simulated risk: **green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red**
   - interactive graphs allow exploration of systemic risk, sector contagion, and hidden dependencies

this pipeline transforms raw financial data into an actionable **knowledge graph**, enabling analysts and researchers to spot vulnerabilities and understand complex interconnections in financial networks
