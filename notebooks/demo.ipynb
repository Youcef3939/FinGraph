    "in this notebook, i built **FinGraph**, a financial knowledge graph, and analyzed systemic risk and contagion across companies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **graph construction:**  \n",
    "   companies and supply-chain relationships were represented as nodes and edges\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **network analysis:**  \n",
    "   centrality metrics identified systemically important companies, and community detection revealed clusters of related firms\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **contagion simulation:**  \n",
    "   simulated financial shocks propagated through the network from seed nodes (`TSLA` and `JPM`), producing **risk scores** for each company\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **visualization:**  \n",
    "   an interactive graph shows node risk via a **green → yellow → red** gradient, making it easy to identify vulnerable companies and hidden dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **key takeaways:**  \n",
    "- `MSFT`, `TSLA`, and `JPM` are the highest-risk nodes in this network  \n",
    "- nodes like `AAPL` inherit moderate risk through their connections\n",
    "- companies with no direct exposure remain low-risk  \n",
    "\n",
    "this workflow demonstrates how **graph-based financial modeling** can provide actionable insights beyond traditional spreadsheet analysis, helping analysts detect systemic risk and sector contagion early"
